## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

### Agile Methodology
**Advantages:**
1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile is highly flexible, allowing for changes and adjustments throughout the project.
2. **Customer Feedback**: Regular feedback from customers ensures the final product meets their expectations and needs.
3. **Faster Delivery**: Iterative development means features are delivered incrementally, often leading to quicker releases.
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Agile promotes teamwork, collaboration, and communication among team members.
5. **Risk Management**: Potential issues can be identified and addressed early through continuous testing and iteration.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Scope Creep**: Due to its flexible nature, Agile can sometimes lead to scope creep if not managed properly.
2. **Lack of Documentation**: Agile focuses more on working software than comprehensive documentation, which might be an issue for some teams.
3. **Requires Experienced Teams**: Agile requires a high level of discipline and experience to implement effectively.
4. **Difficulty in Measuring Progress**: Measuring progress can be challenging due to the iterative nature of Agile.

### Waterfall Methodology
**Advantages:**
1. **Structured Approach**: Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, making it easy to understand and manage.
2. **Clear Documentation**: Emphasizes detailed documentation at every stage, ensuring all requirements are well-documented.
3. **Predictability**: Defined stages and milestones provide a clear path and predictable outcomes.
4. **Easier to Manage**: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and less likely to change.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Inflexibility**: Waterfall is less adaptable to changes once the project is underway, making it difficult to accommodate new requirements.
2. **Late Testing**: Testing is typically done at the end of the development cycle, making it harder to identify and fix issues early.
3. **Risk of Failure**: Any errors or changes detected late in the process can be costly and time-consuming to correct.
4. **Client Involvement**: Limited client involvement until the final stages, which might result in a product that doesn't fully meet their expectations.

### Summary of Differences:
- **Flexibility**: Agile is highly flexible and adaptive, while Waterfall is rigid and linear.
